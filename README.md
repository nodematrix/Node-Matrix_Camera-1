### Description
Node-Matrix Camera-1 is a camera module based on the ESP32 chip, featuring 4MB Flash and 8MB PSRAM. It incorporates the OV2640 image sensor, capable of capturing photos with a resolution of 1600Ã—1200 or transmitting Wi-Fi video.

The module is optimized for expandability, with exposed ports including 10 GPIO pins, UART and I2C interfaces. The on-board DC-DC converters can provide separate power outputs of 5V and 3.3V, each with a capacity of 500mA. It also features built-in charging management, an SD card slot, and an integrated USB interface. Battery detection and camera power control can be achieved through short-circuit jumpers.

### Description
Camera-1 is a camera module based on the ESP32 chip, featuring 4MB of Flash and 8MB of PSRAM. It uses an OV2640 image sensor capable of capturing images at up to 1600Ã—1200 resolution and supports real-time video streaming over Wi-Fi.

The module is optimized for scalability. Breakout ports include 10 GPIOs, along with UART and I2C interfaces. An onboard DC-DC converter provides 5V and 3.3V power outputs, each capable of delivering up to 500mA. Additional features include a built-in USB-to-serial interface, an SD card slot, and battery charging management. By shorting the designated solder jumper pads, you can enable battery voltage detection and camera power control.
